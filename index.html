                <p>The WanderSol Pack is a rugged, futuristic, and eco-friendly backpack that harnesses the power of the sun. The built-in panel, when fully charged, can power your phone, a small radio, a portable light or even a small personal-sized fan.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>The Wandersol backpackâ€™s anti-scratch, hardened solar panels absorb precious energy from the sun and can either charge your small device via an external cable connection, or by charging a small power bank. The panel will provide 7800 mAh. It offers 9 - volt power once completely charged. Simply use the Wandersol app to find the optimal current position of the sun, and let the sun do the work!</p>
